            Seemingly infinite interest in computer science and various technologies. Always keen to learn new skills and tackle challenges. Specialising in web development, and object oriented programming; with a jack-of-all-trades approach in learning relevant skills. I wish to learn and expand my skills and knowledge. I have high competency with tools such as HTML and CSS, along with back-end skills involving PHP and SQL. I spend time researching new methods, and development of my own efficient versions of certain libraries or frameworks, such as my own responsive design framework. 

With my atypical jack-of-all-trades approach, I also learn skills useful for my work. These include things such as principles of design, use of white and negative space, or colour design. With these skills I learnt how to utilize tools such as Photoshop when needed, or Adobe XD to create designs and prototypes of websites as proof of concept. With my vast understanding of the craft I've learnt to pick up new skills rather efficiently, and learning new tools such as WordPress, Angular, or Photoshop don't pose much of a challenge in most cases.
